# GoTools
All of the tools I used to rip and decrypt goanimate assets, + some misc. stuff.
## Programs
- GoAnimate Ripper: Tool used to rip assets from GoAnimate.
- GoAnimate Ripper CC: Tool used to rip character creator assets from GoAnimate (code is a bit bad).
- GoAnimate Ripper FreeAction CC: Obsolete; used to rip free actions, however this functionality was merged into Ripper CC.
- GO4: A mass RC4 decryptor.
- GO4CC: A mass RC4 decrpytor for CC themes (probably has bad code.
- Build Tracker: Small tool created to find and download builds of GoAnimate left on servers by mistake.
## Usage
All programs are intended to run in powershell. Honestly haven't used these in a while, so setup may vary. My code comments are old as hell so they will most likely not be very helpful with setup.
